 * react-bootstrap - bootstrap styling for react apps (Alert, Form, etc.).
 * bootstrap - the actual css files that react-bootstrap uses to build its the components we use for styling.
    * Note: this dependency was added in 2020, because we decided hard-coding a version of bootstrap in as link in `index.html` could break react-bootstrap, which counts on the most recent version (read: it did break it, so we had to fix it).
